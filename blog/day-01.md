```

```bash
amplify init
```

## GitHub

- `dev` development branch to store our source code on

```bash
# Create the development branch
git branch dev

# Set this as our default branch for pushing code to
git push --set-upstream origin dev
```

- `main` production branch for the web-packed build
- `deploy.yml` GitHub workflow to deploy our development branch to production

## Deployed

- linked AWS to my GITHUB repository
- it is deployed to the static site generated by the main branch
- should only trigger build if `src` directory changes
