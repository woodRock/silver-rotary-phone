# Idea

- An applicatio to keep track of running progress.
- It has maps, to show the distance that you run.
- A stop watch, with a laps functionality, for timing.
- Reminders, to set a habit for scheduled runs.
- Set goalsfor running targers (time, distance, half-marathon, marathon)
- Summary statistics as graphs; velocity, total distance, time running.
- Interesting infographics (total time running can be compared to other activities.
  - 8.8 km is the height of Mt Everest.
  - Moon is 384,402 km away.
  - 30x Football fields.
- Authentication (Google, Facebook, Email), store data on AWS database, so it can be cross-platform.
- Share results to social media at certain milestones: "Dave ran the height of Mt Everest 10x in the past two weeks".
- History of running on a map, world map of public profiles showing total distance run.
- Friends, profiles. Challenge a friend to a running goal, compare statistics side by side.

## Stack

- This will have a basic modern javascript application technology stack.
- Due to nature of Hackathon I shall lean towards using the AWS ecosystem
